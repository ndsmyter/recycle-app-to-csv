# Recycle! app data to CSV

In Belgium the Recycle! app is used to show when you have to put your garbage outside for collection.
As I only use this app for the calendar, I created a script that will export the information from the site and put it in a CSV file that can be imported in Google Calendar.
So I don't need to have the app installed locally all year long.
